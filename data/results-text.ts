**Calorie Calculator: Understanding Your Results**

Congratulations on using our scientifically-designed calorie calculator! We understand that achieving your health and fitness goals is crucial, and we're here to provide you with reliable and evidence-based information. Our app uses cutting-edge equations and reputable sources to deliver accurate results tailored to your unique needs. Let's dive into the three variables you'll receive and how they were calculated:

**1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):**

Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) represents the number of calories your body requires to maintain its essential physiological functions at rest. It accounts for vital processes such as breathing, circulating blood, controlling body temperature, and supporting organ function. To calculate your BMR, we employ the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation, which has been validated and recommended by scientific research.

**2. Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):**

Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is an estimate of the total number of calories you burn in a day, considering your BMR and physical activity level. We use the Katch-McArdle activity level multipliers, which take into account your self-reported activity level, to calculate this value accurately. It considers your daily activity, exercise routine, and non-exercise activities, providing a more personalized and precise estimate.

**3. Goal Calories:**

Understanding your fitness objectives is vital, and our app assists you in determining the appropriate caloric intake to reach your goals. Based on your selection, we apply scientifically-backed multipliers to your TDEE. If you aim to lose weight, we recommend a reduction to 75% of your TDEE. For weight maintenance, we advise consuming the TDEE value, and for those seeking to gain weight, we suggest an increase to 110% of the TDEE.

Remember, always consult with a qualified healthcare or nutrition professional before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine. Your health is essential, and personalized guidance can be invaluable on your journey to achieving your fitness goals.

Wishing you success and well-being on your path to a healthier lifestyle!
